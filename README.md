 *
 * FANG is a Monte Carlo tool for efficient event generation in restricted
 * (or full) Lorentz-Invariant Phase Space (LIPS). Unlike conventional approaches
 * that always sample the full 4pi solid angle, FANG can also directly generates 
 * events in which selected final-state particles are constrained to fixed 
 * directions or finite angular regions in the laboratory frame.
